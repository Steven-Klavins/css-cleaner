# CSS Cleaner

## About 
With the advent of technologies such as [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) older
vanilla CSS can be left feeling bloated and verbose. Have you recently found an old project
bloated with unused [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) classes? Perhaps over time
your CSS got a little out of hand resulting in stylistic technical debt accruing? This python script may be the
answer to your problems.

## Why I'm Building CSS Cleaner
Truth be told the primary reason for this project was to practice my Python chops! However, with all said and done,
I do hope this may be of use to some of you out there.

**Note:** This project is currently still under development, please check back later for further updates!
